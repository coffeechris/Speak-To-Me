<emph3>Aaron</emph3>( 
<emph3>אַהֲרֹן</emph3>, a word meaning "bearer of martyrs" in
Hebrew (perhaps also, or instead, related to the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="46918.xml">Egyptian</collectionlink>"Aha

<emph3>ʾAhărōn</emph3>), was one of two brothers who play a unique
part in the history of the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="69788.xml">Hebrew people</collectionlink>.
He was the elder son of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1728.xml">Amram</collectionlink>and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="344409.xml">Jochebed</collectionlink>of the tribe
of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="246921.xml">Levi</collectionlink>; 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, the other son,
being three years younger, and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="294492.xml">Miriam</collectionlink>, their sister,
several years older ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>2:4; 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>6:16 ff.; 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>33:39). Aaron
was the great-grandson of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="246921.xml">Levi</collectionlink>( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>6:16-20) and
represented the priestly functions of his tribe. While 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>was receiving his
education at the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9346.xml">Egypt</collectionlink>ian court and
during his exile among the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="316240.xml">Midianites</collectionlink>, Aaron
and his sister remained with their kinsmen in the eastern
border-land of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9346.xml">Egypt</collectionlink>. Here he gained a
name for eloquent and persuasive speech; so that when the time came
for the demand upon 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="23294.xml">Pharaoh</collectionlink>to release
Israel from captivity, Aaron became his brother’s 
<emph2>nabi</emph2>, or spokesman, to his own people ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>4:16) and, after
their unwillingness to hear, to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="23294.xml">Pharaoh</collectionlink>himself ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>7:9).</p>
<section>
<title>His Function</title>Aaron’s function included the duties of
speaker and implied personal dealings with the court on behalf of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, who was always
the central moving figure. The part played by Aaron in the events
that preceded the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>was, therefore,
ministerial, and not directive. He shared the miraculous powers of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, and performed
“signs” before his people which impressed them with a belief in the
reality of the divine mission of the brothers ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>4:15-16). At the
command of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>he stretched out
his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>7:19, 8:1, 12).
In the infliction of the remaining plagues he appears to have acted
merely as the attendant of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, whose
outstretched rod drew the divine wrath upon 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="23294.xml">Pharaoh</collectionlink>and his
subjects ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>9:23, 10:13, 22).
The potency of Aaron’s rod had already been demonstrated by its
victory over the rods of the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9346.xml">Egypt</collectionlink>ian magicians,
which it swallowed after all the rods alike had been turned into
serpents ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>7:9 
<emph2>et seq.</emph2>). During the journey in the wilderness Aaron
is not always prominent or active; and he sometimes appears guilty
of rebellious or treasonable conduct. At the battle with 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="68643.xml">Amalek</collectionlink>he is chosen with

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1698604.xml">Hur</collectionlink>to support the hand of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>that held the “rod
of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11855.xml">God</collectionlink>” ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>17:9 
<emph2>et seq.</emph2>). When the revelation was given to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>at 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="27644.xml">Sinai</collectionlink>, he headed the
elders of Israel who accompanied 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>on the way to the
summit. 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="16121.xml">Joshua</collectionlink>, however, was
admitted with his leader to the very presence of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">the Lord</collectionlink>, while Aaron
and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1698604.xml">Hur</collectionlink>remained below to look
after the people ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>24:9-14). It was
during the prolonged absence of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>that Aaron yielded
to the clamors of the people, and made a golden calf as a visible
image of the divinity who had delivered them from 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9346.xml">Egypt</collectionlink>( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>32:1-6). At the
intercession of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, Aaron was saved
from the plague which smote the people ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8547.xml">Deuteronomy</collectionlink>9:20; 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>32:35), although
it was to Aaron’s tribe of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="246921.xml">Levi</collectionlink>that the work of
punitive vengeance was committed ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>32:26 
<emph2>et seq.</emph2>).</section>

<title>Becomes Priest of Israel</title>At the time when the tribe
of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="246921.xml">Levi</collectionlink>was set apart for the
priestly service, Aaron was anointed and consecrated to the
priesthood, arrayed in the robes of his office, and instructed in
its manifold duties ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>28 and 29). On
the very day of his consecration his sons, 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="69703.xml">Nadab</collectionlink>and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="68543.xml">Abihu</collectionlink>, were consumed by
fire from 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">the Lord</collectionlink>for having
offered incense in an unlawful manner (

stroke Aaron bore in silence.</section>

<title>Rebellion of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="608565.xml">Korah</collectionlink></title>From the
time of the sojourn at 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="27644.xml">Sinai</collectionlink>, where he became
the anointed priest of Israel, Aaron ceased to be the minister of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, his place being
taken by 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="16121.xml">Joshua</collectionlink>. He is mentioned
in association with 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="294492.xml">Miriam</collectionlink>in a jealous
complaint against the exclusive claims of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>as 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">the Lord</collectionlink>’s prophet.
The presumption of the murmurers was rebuked, and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="294492.xml">Miriam</collectionlink>was smitten with
leprosy. Aaron entreated 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>to intercede for
her, at the same time confessing the sin and folly that prompted
the uprising. Aaron himself was not struck with the plague on
account of sacerdotal immunity; and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="294492.xml">Miriam</collectionlink>, after seven
days’ quarantine, was healed and restored to favor ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>12). It is
noteworthy that the prophet 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="20284.xml">Micah</collectionlink>(6:4) mentions 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, Aaron, and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="294492.xml">Miriam</collectionlink>as the leaders of
Israel after the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>(a judgment
wholly in accord with the tenor of the narratives). In the present
instance it is made clear by the express words of the oracle ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>12:6-8) that 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>was unique among
men as the one with whom 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">the Lord</collectionlink>spoke face to
face. The failure to recognize or concede this prerogative of their
brother was the sin of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="294492.xml">Miriam</collectionlink>and Aaron. The
validity of the exclusive priesthood of the family of Aaron was
attested after the ill-fated rebellion of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="608565.xml">Korah</collectionlink>, who was a first
cousin of Aaron. When the earth had opened and swallowed up the
leaders of the insurgents ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>16:25-35), 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="745476.xml">Eleazar</collectionlink>, the son of
Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead
priests. And when the plague had broken out among the people who
had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, took his censer
and stood between the living and the dead till the plague was
stayed ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>17:1-15,
16:36-50, Authorized Version). Another memorable transaction
followed. Each of the tribal princes of Israel took a rod and wrote
his name upon it, and the twelve rods were laid up over night in
the tent of meeting. On the morrow Aaron’s rod was found to have
budded and blossomed and borne ripe almonds ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>17:8; see 
<unknownlink src="Aaron’s Rod">Aaron’s Rod</unknownlink>). The
miracle proved merely the prerogative of the tribe of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="246921.xml">Levi</collectionlink>; but now a formal
distinction was made in perpetuity between the family of Aaron and
the other 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="70577.xml">Levites</collectionlink>. While all the

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="70577.xml">Levites</collectionlink>(and only 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="70577.xml">Levites</collectionlink>) were to be
devoted to sacred services, the special charge of the sanctuary and
the altar was committed to the Aaronites alone ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>18:1-7). The
scene of this enactment is unknown, nor is the time
mentioned.</section>

<title>Death</title>Aaron, like 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, was not permitted
to enter 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="50250.xml">Canaan</collectionlink>with the
successful invaders. The reason alleged is that the two brothers
showed impatience at Meribah (Kadesh) in the last year of the
desert pilgrimage ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>20:12, 13),
when they, or rather 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, brought water out
of a rock to quench the thirst of the people. The action was
construed as displaying a want of deference to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">the Lord</collectionlink>, since they
had been commanded to speak to the rock, whereas 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>struck it with the
wonder-working rod ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>20:7-11). Of
the death of Aaron we have two accounts. The principal one gives a
detailed statement to the effect that, soon after the above
incident, Aaron, with his son 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="745476.xml">Eleazar</collectionlink>and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, ascended 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1682252.xml">Mount Hor</collectionlink>. There 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>stripped him
(Aaron) of his priestly garments, and transferred them to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="745476.xml">Eleazar</collectionlink>. Aaron died on
the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty
days ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>20:22-29;
compare 33:38, 39). The other account is found in 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8547.xml">Deuteronomy</collectionlink>10:6,
where 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>is reported as
saying that Aaron died at 
<unknownlink src="Mosera">Mosera</unknownlink>and was buried
there. 
<unknownlink src="Mosera">Mosera</unknownlink>is not on 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1682252.xml">Mount Hor</collectionlink>, since the
itinerary in 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>33:31-37
records seven stages between 
<unknownlink src="Moseroth">Moseroth</unknownlink>( 
<unknownlink src="Mosera">Mosera</unknownlink>) and

<title>Typical Signification in Apocryphal and Rabbinical
Literature</title>The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld
in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior
to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11855.xml">God</collectionlink>and lacking the
will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous
proclivities. Thus Aaron, the typical priest, ranks far below 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>: he is but his
mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11855.xml">God</collectionlink>revealed through 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, although it is
pointed out (Sifra, Wa-yiḳra, 1) that it is said fifteen times in
the Pentateuch that “ 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">the Lord</collectionlink>spoke to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>
<emph2>and</emph2>Aaron.” Under the influence of the priesthood
which shaped the destinies of the nation under 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="940286.xml">Persian</collectionlink>rule, a
different ideal of the priest was formed, as is learned from 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="20285.xml">Malachi</collectionlink>2:4-7; and the
prevailing tendency was to place Aaron on a footing equal with 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>. “At times Aaron,
and at other times 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, is mentioned
first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank,”
says Mekilta בא, 1; and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="73659.xml">Ecclesiasticus</collectionlink>(

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="73659.xml">Sirach</collectionlink>), 44:6-24,
expressly infers this when introducing in his record of renowned
men the glowing description of Aaron’s ministration.</section>

Compared</title>According to Tanḥuma (ed. Buber, 2:12), Aaron’s
activity as a prophet began earlier than that of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>. The writer of the
Testaments of the Patriarchs, however, hesitates to rank 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>the faithful, “him
that speaks with 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11855.xml">God</collectionlink>as with a father,” as
equal with Aaron (Testament of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="246921.xml">Levi</collectionlink>, 8:17). The rabbis
are still more emphatic in their praise of Aaron’s virtues. Thus
Hillel, who in Herod’s time saw before him mainly a degenerate
class of priests, selfish and quarrelsome, held Aaron of old up as
a mirror, saying: “Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and
pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto
the Law!” (Abot, 1:12). This is further illustrated by the
tradition preserved in Abot de-Rabbi Natan 12, Sanhedrin 6b, and
elsewhere, according to which Aaron was an ideal priest of the
people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>. While 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>was stern and
uncompromising, brooking no wrong, Aaron went about as peacemaker,
reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with
his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into
the right way by his friendly intercourse. The mourning of the
people at Aaron’s death was greater, therefore, than at that of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>; for whereas, when
Aaron died the whole house of Israel wept, including the women ( 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>20:29), 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>was bewailed by
“the sons of Israel” only ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8547.xml">Deuteronomy</collectionlink>x24:8).
Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating
circumstances for Aaron (Sanhedrin 7a). His fortitude and silent
submission to the will of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11855.xml">God</collectionlink>on the loss of his two
sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11855.xml">God</collectionlink>in the midst of great
affliction (Zebaḥim 115b; 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="16494.xml">Josephus</collectionlink>, “ 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1313974.xml">Antiquities of the
Jews</collectionlink>” 3:8, § 7). Especially significant are the
words represented as being spoken by 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11855.xml">God</collectionlink>after the princes of
the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="52949.xml">Twelve Tribes</collectionlink>had
brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared
Tabernacle: “Say to thy brother Aaron: Greater than the gifts of
the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the
light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the
Temple lasts, thy light of the Law shall last forever” (Tanḥuma,
ed. Buber, בהעלותך, 6).</section>

<title>Death of Aaron</title>In fulfillment of the promise of
peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="18187.xml">Leviticus</collectionlink>Rabbah 10,
Midrash Tehilim 133:1), Aaron’s death, as described in the
Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquillity. Accompanied by 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, his brother, and
by 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="745476.xml">Eleazar</collectionlink>, his son,
Aaron went to the summit of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1682252.xml">Mount Hor</collectionlink>, where the
rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp
presented itself to his view. “Take off thy priestly raiment and
place it upon thy son 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="745476.xml">Eleazar</collectionlink>!” said 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>; “and then follow
me.” Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was
prepared a bed around which angels stood. “Go lie down upon thy
bed, my brother,” 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>continued; and
Aaron obeyed without a murmur. Then his soul departed as if by a
kiss from 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="11855.xml">God</collectionlink>. The cave closed
behind 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>as he left; and he
went down the hill with 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="745476.xml">Eleazar</collectionlink>, with garments
rent, and crying: “Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of
supplication of Israel!” When the Israelites cried in bewilderment,
“Where is Aaron?” angels were seen carrying Aaron’s bier through
the air. A voice was then heard saying: “The law of truth was in
his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with
me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin” ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="20285.xml">Malachi</collectionlink>2:6, 7). He
died, according to Seder ‘Olam R. 9, Rosh ha-Shanah 2, 3a, and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="16494.xml">Josephus</collectionlink>, “ 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1313974.xml">Antiquities of the
Jews</collectionlink>” 4:4, § 7, on the first of Ab. 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="16494.xml">Josephus</collectionlink>says also
that “he died while the multitude looked upon him.” The pillar of
cloud which proceeded in front of Israel’s camp disappeared at
Aaron’s death (see Seder ‘Olam, 9 and Rosh ha-Shanah 2b-3a). The
seeming contradiction between 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>20:22 
<emph2>et seq.</emph2>and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8547.xml">Deuteronomy</collectionlink>10:6 is
solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron’s death on 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1682252.xml">Mount Hor</collectionlink>was marked
by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in
consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations
backward to 
<unknownlink src="Moseroth">Mosera</unknownlink>, where they
performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said:
“There 
<unknownlink src="at &lt;wikipedialink src=">
Mosera</unknownlink>"&gt;at 
<unknownlink src="Moseroth">Mosera</unknownlink>died Aaron.”
See Mekilta, Beshallaḥ, Wayassa’, 1; Tanḥuma, Huḳḳat, 18;
Yerushalmi Soṭah, 1:17c, and Targum Yerushalmi 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8547.xml">Deuteronomy</collectionlink>on the
above-mentioned passages. The rabbis also dwell with special
laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united Aaron and 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>. When the latter
was appointed ruler and Aaron high priest, neither betrayed any
jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one another’s greatness. When 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>at first declined
to go to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="23294.xml">Pharaoh</collectionlink>, saying: “O my
Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send” ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>4:13), he was
unwilling to deprive Aaron, his brother, of the high position the
latter had held for so many years; but 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">the Lord</collectionlink>reassured
him, saying: “Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his
heart” ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>4:14). Indeed,
Aaron was to find his reward, says Simon ben Yoḥai; for that heart
which had leaped with joy over his younger brother’s rise to glory
greater than his was decorated with the Urim and Thummim, which
were to “be upon Aaron’s heart when he goeth in before 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">the Lord</collectionlink>” (Canticles
Rabbah 1:10). 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>and Aaron met in
gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="9662.xml">Exodus</collectionlink>4:27; compare 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="28582.xml">Song of Songs</collectionlink>,
8:1), and of them it is written: “Behold how good and how pleasant 
<unknownlink src="it is">it is</unknownlink>for brethren to
dwell together in unity!” ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="24203.xml">Psalms</collectionlink>133:1). Of them
it is said ( 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="24203.xml">Psalms</collectionlink>85:10): “Mercy
and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed 
<unknownlink src="each other">each other</unknownlink>”; for 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>stood for
righteousness, according to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8547.xml">Deuteronomy</collectionlink>33:21,
and Aaron for peace, according to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="20285.xml">Malachi</collectionlink>2:6. Again,
mercy was personified in Aaron, according to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8547.xml">Deuteronomy</collectionlink>33:8,
and truth in 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>, according to 
<unknownlink src="Numbers">Numbers</unknownlink>12:7 (Tanḥuma,
Shemot, ed. Buber, 24-26). 
<p>When 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="19577.xml">Moses</collectionlink>poured the oil of
anointment upon the head of Aaron, Aaron modestly shrank back and
said: “Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this
sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office.” Then the Holy Spirit
spake the words: “Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that
ran down upon the beard of Aaron, that even went down to the skirts
of his garment, is as pure as the dew of 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="316428.xml">Hermon</collectionlink>” (

<p>Recently, the tradition that 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="72346.xml">Kohanim</collectionlink>are actually
descended from Aaron was supported by 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="310782.xml">genetic
testing</collectionlink>(Skorecki et al., 1997). Since all direct
male lineage shares a common 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="246891.xml">Y chromosome</collectionlink>,
testing was done across sectors of the Jewish population to see if
there was any commonality between their Y chromosomes. There was
proven to be certain distinctions among the "Kohen" Y chromosomes,
implying that the Kohanim do share some common ancestry. This
information was used to support the claim of the

that they were in fact, a tribe of Jews.</p>

<title>According to the Documentary Hypothesis</title>
<p>The Biblical representation of his character, negative and
shadowy compared with Moses's, may be viewed in several ways. A
clue to the seemingly contradictory delineations of Aaron (other
than the obvious explanation that he is a complex character) is
found in the framework of documentary analysis (see also 
<emph2>
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="517878.xml">Hexateuch</collectionlink>

According to those who accept the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="61345.xml">documentary

<emph3>Aaron as fallible</emph3>. These passages do not represent
Aaron as a sacrosanct 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="23707.xml">priest</collectionlink>. He comes to
meet Moses (

jurisprudence (Exodus 24:14). He yields to the people and makes the

subsequently punished ( 
<emph2>Numbers</emph2>12). He is present at the sacrificial

In this aspect, 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="16121.xml">Joshua</collectionlink>, instead of

<emph3>Aaron as Moses's prophet</emph3>. This representation
concerns the covenant meal on

9-11) and the vague charge that Aaron "let the people loose"
(Exodus 32:25). Aaron seems to be an afterthought in the plague
narrative (Exodus 8:25). In both this and the last view, Moses is
the viceregent of God and Aaron is Moses' prophet (Exodus 4:16,
7:1).</item>
<item>
<emph3>Aaron as idolatrous</emph3>. In 
<emph2>
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="8547.xml">Deuteronomy</collectionlink>
</emph2>9, Aaron is partly responsible for the building of the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="857078.xml">Golden Calf</collectionlink>. The
story says that 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="30620.xml">Yahweh</collectionlink>is so angry
toward Aaron that he was about to destroy him. It appears that it
is only Moses's intercessory prayer and his destruction of the
Golden Calf which saves Aaron. The account of his death in
Deuteromy 10:6 is different from that in Numbers 20:22. According
to Deuteronomy it occurred at 
<unknownlink src="Moseroth">Moserah</unknownlink>, seven
stations from 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="1682252.xml">Mount Hor</collectionlink>(Numbers
33:30), in the early months of the wandering because of the sign of
the Golden Calf. The only other passage in reference to Aaron in
Deuteronomy merely states that he is the brother of Moses
(Deuteronomy 32:50).</item>
<item>
<emph3>Aaron as subordinate</emph3>. The first three, simpler,
plagues Aaron brings on at Moses' command; thereafter Moses himself
is the actor. In the narratives (Numbers 16, 17) it is Moses in
each case who vindicates him. Aaron dies at Mount Hor in the
fortieth year of the Exodus (Numbers 20:22, 33:38), because of
rebellion at
