Neolithic Period
</collectionlink> (around 4000 BCE), Achill had a population of 500-1000 people. The island would have been mostly forest until the Neolithic people began crop cultivation. Settlememt increased during the

</collectionlink>, and the dispersal of small forts around the coast indicate the warlike nature of the times.

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="32066.xml">
Ulster
</collectionlink>, due to the political and religious turmoil of the time. For a while there was two different

<title>Sights </title><p>
Despite some unsympathetic development, the island retains some striking natural beauty.  The cliffs of Croaghaun on the northern coast of the island are the highest sea cliffs in

The mountain Slievemore (671 metres) rises dramatically in the centre of the island and the Atlantic drive (along the south/west of the island) has some dramatically beautiful views. On the slopes of Slievemore, there is an abandoned village ("The Deserted Village") left intact after it was abandoned and left to be destroyed by the elements during the

<title>Economy </title><p>
While a number of attempts at setting up small industrial units on the island have been made, the economy of the island is largely dependent on 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="29789.xml">
tourism
</collectionlink>. Subventions from Achill people working abroad, in particular in

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="627.xml">
Agriculture
</collectionlink> plays a small role and is only profitable because of European subsidies. The fact that the island is mostly bog means that it is limited - largely to 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="915258.xml">

</collectionlink>. In the past,

fishing
</collectionlink> was a significant activity but this aspect of the economy is small now. At one stage, the island was known for its shark fishing,

</collectionlink> before which life was tough and difficult on the island.  Since that heyday, the common perception is that tourism has been slowly declining.

Some of the recent building development on the island (over the last 40 years or so) has been contentious and in many cases is not as sympathetic to the landscape as the earlier style of

<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="34558.xml">
twentieth century
</collectionlink>.  An example of the style of earlier housing can be seen in the "Deserted Village" ruins near the graveyard at the foot of Slievemore.  Even the houses in this village represent a relatively comfortable class of dwelling as, even as recently as a hundred years ago, some people still used "Beehive" style houses (small circular single roomed dwellings with a hole in ceiling to let out smoke).  Many of the oldest and most picturesque inhabitated cottages date from the activities of the 
<collectionlink xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="954882.xml">
Congested Districts Board for Ireland
</collectionlink> - a body set up around the turn of the twentieth century in Ireland to improve the welfare for inhabitants of small villages and towns.  Most of the homes in Achill at the time were very small and tightly packed together in villages.  The CDB subsidised the building of new, more spacious (though still small by modern standards) homes outside of the traditional villages.
